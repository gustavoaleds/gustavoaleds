## Hi, DEV's! My name is Gustavo and bellow you can meet me better

I'm an *developer* who seeks knowledge every day! I believe that 99.9% (probaly more, trust me) of problems can be solved by coding. I believe in a better world being created by creative, proactive and - above all - **human people**.<br/>
I am currently studying Javascript and Python, however, I have knowledge in some programming languages like HTML and CSS.
